# AirBnB_clone

<br><br>
# About
This project is the first phase in the AirBNB clone for the Higher Level Programming course at Holberton, and contains the files for this project. For this project we create a custom data management CLI comprising all we have learned so far in Python.
<br><br>
# Console
The console is a command line interface which will allow users to create allowed classes, delete classes, and/or add attributes to classes. This console will work in interactive and non-interacive mode.


# How to use <br>
## Interactive Mode

Launch the console:

```
/AirBnb_clone$ ./console.py
```

upon launching interactive mode, you will be given a new (hbnb command prompt.) 

Example:<br>
```
(hbnb) create BaseModel
```

## Non-Interacive Mode<br>

For non-interactive mode, echo allowed commands and pipe into console.py

Example:<br>
```
AirBnb$ echo "create BaseModel" | ./console.py
```

# Classes
## List of classes
